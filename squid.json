	"step2":"A group of 456 people from all walks of life are invited to play a series of children's games with life-threatening consequences to have a chance to win a â‚©45.6 billion (US$38.7 million) prize.",
	"step3":"Hwang based the narrative on Korean games of his childhood to show the irony of a childhood game where competition was not important becoming an extreme competition with people's lives at stake. The central game he selected, the squid game, was a popular Korean children's game from the 1970s and 1980s. The Red light, green light game was selected because of its potential to make a lot of losers in one go",
	"step4":"Complete Verification",
        "step5":"Regarding the selection, Hwang said The game was selected because the scene filled with so many people randomly moving and stopping could be viewed as a ridiculous but a sad group dance. Hwang joked that the dalgona candy game they chose may influence sales of dalgona, similar to how sales of Korean gats (traditional hats) had bloomed after broadcast of series Kingdom.",
	"step6":"Hwang wrote all of the series himself, taking nearly six months to write the first two episodes alone, after which he turned to friends to get input on moving forward. Hwang also addressed the challenges of preparing for the show which was physically and mentally exhausting, saying six of his teeth fell out while making Season 1. Hwang mentioned that he has no immediate plans to write a sequel to Squid Game, stating that he did not have well-developed plans for a follow-up story and if he were to write one, he would likely have a staff of writers and directors to help.",
	"step7":"The robot girl doll in the first episode of the series, Red light, Green light was inspired by Younghee, a character who appears alongside another character named Chulsoo on the cover of Korean textbooks from the 70s and 80s.
